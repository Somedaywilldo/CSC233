READEME

Dear TA, this file may help you test our parser more easily.

For tests, just type in this in shell:

$ sh run_test.sh

this will compile the compiler and run several tests in the tests/ directory.


We designed several test cases:

Positive Tests (should pass):

pass_1: Just a right code.


Negative Tests (should fail):

fail_1: Wrong declaration.
fail_2: Missing data type.
fail_3: Using data type as variable name.
fail_4: Unpaired brackets.
fail_5: Using digits as variable name.
fail_6: Wrong syntax.
